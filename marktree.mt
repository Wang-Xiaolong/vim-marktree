The MARKTREE light-weight markup language <mt^>

Like Markdown, the Marktree markup language is light-weight.
  For me, it means you can easily get the meaning of its gramma elements
   without learning; and it won't annoy you much if you don't know them.
 It was designed to implements two things: 'Tree' and 'Mark'.
	'Tree' means you can assign levels to your text lines.
	 The levels are visually distinct.
	 And with folding support, you can browse from headings,
	  and keep just the section you read in you console windows.
	'Mark' means you can mark emphasis, keyword, issue, todo or comment
	  in your text, with a few strait forward signs.
	 The signs are in unified format, and easy to be understand.
	 And with syntax highlighting, they are more distinct to you.
The document is organized as following:
 Chapter "Tree of Text" will introduce the format of normal test;
 Chapter "Headings" will describe the format of titles and headings,
  those are with higher levels than normal text.
 Chapter "Marks" will show you the format of the marks.

== Trees of Text: Indent-based, like writing code ==
In normal writing, content is organized paragraph by paragraph;
  and inside a paragraph, it's sentence by sentence.
Marktree is different: it recommends a code-like style:
  function by function, line by line, and indent to show levels.

== Headings ==
-- File Title --
-- Section Heading --
-- Normal Heading --

# Normal #

== Marks ==
-- Standard and Strict Marks --
