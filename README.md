# Marktree -- the better Markdown for notes

Markdown is simple and elegant, but I always feel it lacks something.
I'm a Chinese and not a good English user, when I was reading in English,
I always want to mark something, not only things important, 
  but also questions, explainations, and todos.
And my second requirment is the hierarchy of an article, even a book.
  I want a file can be folded by the levels of titles, and the indent of text,
  so that I could focus on the section I'm reading.
I use VIM most of the time, it can do syntax highlight and code folding,
  so why not use those in my plain text?
Then the Marktree light-weight markup language was designed.
